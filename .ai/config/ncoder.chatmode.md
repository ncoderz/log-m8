<DEFINITION: AI Memory Instructions>

As an AI, you will record any important information of which you are not intrinsically aware.
This information is known as a 'memory'.

The purpose is to create an information database that can be used to improve future interactions
and output.

Maintain a human-readable, Markdown memory log structured as follows:

- /.ai/memory/index.md - root index for memories.
- /.ai/memory/index-[a-z0-9-]+.md - a sub-index for memories.
- /.ai/memory/memory-[a-z0-9-]+.md - a specific memory.

The memory structure must be such that memories are fast to retrieve, therefore it is important
to limit the size of indexes and use sub-indexes.

A memory is defined as any piece of information of which you are not intrinsically
aware, and could be later used to improve future interactions and output.

Memories themselves should in general record the WHY and the HOW, rather than the WHAT.
They should be written in the format that best fits this goal of improve future interactions
and output.

## Memory Index Spec

```markdown
## /.ai/memory/index-<up to 200 char summary>

<summary of the sub-index to aid retrieval>

## /.ai/memory/index-<up to 200 char summary>

<summary of the sub-index to aid retrieval>

etc...
```

## Memory Spec

```markdown
<format that best fits the goal of memories>
```

## Using Memories

As you proceed with your task, regularly consult your memory database to see if there is anything
relevant that can be used.

Ignore memories that start with **FORGOTTEN, IGNORE THIS MEMORY**

## Creating Memories

If you gain new knowledge from the user or another source, record that knowledge as a memory.
Only create a new memory if this makes sense, otherwise update existing memories.

## Maintaining Memories

If the user asks you to forget something, do not delete the memory, instead write
**FORGOTTEN, IGNORE THIS MEMORY** at the start of the memory file.

Restructure memory files and indexes if it makes sense.

<DEFINITION: AI Logging Instructions>

As an AI, you will log your actions and decisions in a structured manner to ensure traceability and
accountability. This logging will help in understanding the AI's behavior, debugging issues, and
improving future interactions.

Maintain a human-readable, append-only Markdown log in a file named `/.ai/log/ai-log.md`.

## FORMAT (exact structure)

```markdown
## <YYYY-MM-DD> (ISO date)

### <Concise feature/change title in sentence case>

<1–3 sentence high-level summary of WHAT changed and WHY. Present tense.>

- **Affects:** `[code]` `[spec]` `[test]` `[doc]` `[other]` <!-- Keep only the tags that truly changed; order as shown -->
- **Issue:** [#<number>](actual link to issue in github) <!-- Only if available -->
- **Pull Request:** [#<number>](actual link to pull-request in github) <!-- Only if available -->

#### <path/to/file_or_dir.ext>

- `<Tag>` <short, concrete description of the change>
- `<Tag>` <…>

#### <next/path.ext>

- `<Tag>` <…>

<!-- Continue "### <path>" sections for each touched file or doc. Group roughly as: src/*, spec/*, doc/*, test/* in that order. Leave a blank line between entries and between file sections. -->

## TAGS (use exactly these labels; choose the right ones)

- Tag format it `<Code|Comment|Spec|Doc|Test|Other> <+|-|~>`
  - `+` Added
  - `-` Removed
  - `~` Modified
  - `Code` Code, types, models, functions, or commands (non-doc).
  - `Comment` Inline/API comments/JSDoc/docstrings in source files.
  - `Spec` Specifications / requirements.
  - `Doc` End-user or API documentation (non-spec).
  - `Test` Tests or fixtures.
  - `Other` Anything that cannot fit the above tags.

(Do NOT invent other tags.)

## RULES

- Always append new entries under today’s `## YYYY-MM-DD` heading, creating it if missing.
- The log reads in reverse chronological order, so the most recent changes are at the top.
```

## Example Entries

```markdown
## 2023-10-08

### Implement status filters and bulk clear-completed

Adds UI filter tabs (All / Active / Completed) and a bulk action to remove all completed todos. Preserves the selected filter in the URL hash (e.g. `#/active`).

- **Affects:** `[code]` `[spec]` `[test]` `[doc]`
- **Issue:** [#212](https://github.com/userX/todo-list/issues/212)
- **Pull Request:** [#456](https://github.com/userX/todo-list/pull/456)

#### src/components/TodoList.tsx

- `Code +` Implemented filter logic and tabs; added `clearCompleted()` action.
- `Code ~` Refactored list rendering to derive visible items from `filter` state and memoized selectors.
- `Comment ~` Added JSDoc for `applyFilter(status)` and URL hash synchronization.

#### spec/spec.md

- `Spec +` Added FR-020 “Filter todos by status (All/Active/Completed)”.
- `Spec +` Added FR-021 “Bulk clear completed todos”.
- `Spec ~` Clarified expected behavior for empty states under each filter.

#### doc/api.md

- `Doc ~` Documented route hash mapping (`#/`, `#/active`, `#/completed`) and filter persistence rules.
- `Doc ~` Added usage notes for `clearCompleted()` and its non-destructive confirmation prompt.

#### test/unit/filters.test.ts

- `Test +` Coverage for filter transitions, URL hash sync, and list reactivity.
- `Test +` Ensures `clearCompleted()` removes only completed items and emits `todos:cleared` event.

### Add due dates with natural-language parsing and overdue highlighting

Introduces optional `dueAt` on todos, supports quick entry like “tomorrow 5pm” or “next Monday”, and highlights overdue tasks. Timezone-aware using the app’s configured TZ.

- **Affects:** `[code]` `[spec]` `[test]` `[doc]`
- **Issue:** [#198](https://github.com/userX/todo-list/issues/198)
- **Pull Request:** [#441](https://github.com/userX/todo-list/pull/441)

#### src/models/Todo.ts

- `Code +` Added `dueAt?: Date` to `Todo` model and serializer.
- `Code +` Implemented `parseDueDate(input: string, tz: string): Date | null`.
- `Code ~` Computed `isOverdue` and `dueIn` getters for badge rendering.
- `Comment ~` Documented parsing assumptions and ambiguity resolution (prefers upcoming weekday).

#### spec/spec.md

- `Spec +` Added FR-022 “Todos may have an optional due date”.
- `Spec +` Added FR-023 “Overdue todos must be visually indicated and sorted after active soon-due”.
- `Spec ~` Defined parsing rules for common phrases and 24h/12h time formats.

#### doc/api.md

- `Doc ~` Updated Task schema with `dueAt` (ISO 8601) and `isOverdue` (derived) fields.
- `Doc ~` Added examples for quick-entry syntax and error messages for invalid dates.

#### test/unit/due-date.test.ts

- `Test +` Cases for “today”, “tomorrow 17:00”, “next Monday 9am”, and invalid inputs.
- `Test +` Verifies timezone handling (DST edge), `isOverdue` logic, and sort order with mixed due dates.
```

// - Timestamps are ISO 8601 format in UTC
// - Category "Uncategorized" is system-provided and cannot be deleted
// - Completed todos cannot be deleted, only archived after 30 days
// - Search uses full-text search on title and description fields

<DEFINITION END>


<DEFINITION: Coding Mode Instructions>

## Core Principles

- Write high-quality, idiomatic code.
- Always apply the DRY principle.
- User instructions always override other rules.

<DEFINITION END>


<DEFINITION: Test Writing Mode Instructions>

Tests should be written and run using `vitest` and be stored in the following folders:

- /test/unit
- /test/performance
- /test/security
- /test/usability
- /test/integration


Test coverage of the code should be as close to 100% as practicable.

<DEFINITION END>


<DEFINITION: Code Documentation Mode Instructions>

## Core Principle

Document APIs in detail, and code where it clarifies behaviour.
Avoid in-code  documentation that is self-explanatory.

## Commenting Guidelines

### ❌ AVOID These Comment Types

**Obvious Comments**

```javascript
// Bad: States the obvious
let counter = 0; // Initialize counter to zero
counter++; // Increment counter by one
```

**Redundant Comments**

```javascript
// Bad: Comment repeats the code
function getUserName() {
  return user.name; // Return the user's name
}
```

**Outdated Comments**

```javascript
// Bad: Comment doesn't match the code
// Calculate tax at 5% rate
const tax = price * 0.08; // Actually 8%
```

### ✅ WRITE These Comment Types

**Complex Business Logic**

```javascript
// Good: Explains WHY this specific calculation
// Apply progressive tax brackets: 10% up to 10k, 20% above
const tax = calculateProgressiveTax(income, [0.1, 0.2], [10000]);
```

**Non-obvious Algorithms**

```javascript
// Good: Explains the algorithm choice
// Using Floyd-Warshall for all-pairs shortest paths
// because we need distances between all nodes
for (let k = 0; k < vertices; k++) {
  for (let i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < vertices; j++) {
      // ... implementation
    }
  }
}
```

**Regex Patterns**

```javascript
// Good: Explains what the regex matches
// Match email format: username@domain.extension
const emailPattern = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;
```

**API Constraints or Gotchas**

```javascript
// Good: Explains external constraint
// GitHub API rate limit: 5000 requests/hour for authenticated users
await rateLimiter.wait();
const response = await fetch(githubApiUrl);
```

## Decision Framework

Before writing a comment, ask:

1. **Is the code self-explanatory?** → No comment needed
2. **Would a better variable/function name eliminate the need?** → Refactor instead
3. **Does this explain WHY, not WHAT?** → Good comment
4. **Will this help future maintainers?** → Good comment

## Special Cases for Comments

### Public APIs

Use Typedoc.

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate compound interest using the standard formula.
 *
 * @param {number} principal - Initial amount invested
 * @param {number} rate - Annual interest rate (as decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
 * @param {number} time - Time period in years
 * @param {number} compoundFrequency - How many times per year interest compounds (default: 1)
 * @returns {number} Final amount after compound interest
 */
function calculateCompoundInterest(principal, rate, time, compoundFrequency = 1) {
  // ... implementation
}
```

### Configuration and Constants

```javascript
// Good: Explains the source or reasoning
const MAX_RETRIES = 3; // Based on network reliability studies
const API_TIMEOUT = 5000; // AWS Lambda timeout is 15s, leaving buffer
```

### Annotations

```javascript
// TODO: Replace with proper user authentication after security review
// FIXME: Memory leak in production - investigate connection pooling
// HACK: Workaround for bug in library v2.1.0 - remove after upgrade
// NOTE: This implementation assumes UTC timezone for all calculations
// WARNING: This function modifies the original array instead of creating a copy
// PERF: Consider caching this result if called frequently in hot path
// SECURITY: Validate input to prevent SQL injection before using in query
// BUG: Edge case failure when array is empty - needs investigation
// REFACTOR: Extract this logic into separate utility function for reusability
// DEPRECATED: Use newApiFunction() instead - this will be removed in v3.0
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Divider Comments

```javascript
// Bad: Don't use decorative comments
//=====================================
// UTILITY FUNCTIONS
//=====================================
```

## Quality Checklist

Before committing, ensure your comments:

- [ ] Explain WHY, not WHAT
- [ ] Are grammatically correct and clear
- [ ] Will remain accurate as code evolves
- [ ] Add genuine value to code understanding
- [ ] Are placed appropriately (above the code they describe)
- [ ] Use proper spelling and professional language

<DEFINITION END>


<DEFINITION: Task Completion Instructions>

When you have completed all modes, all memories have been updated, and the AI log has been
written, you have completed the task.

Inform the user the task is complete with the following checklist:

- [ ] <mode> completed (for each executed mode)
- [ ] Memories updated
- [ ] AI log written

<DEFINITION END>




<DEFINITION: YOUR TASK>

You have five modes of operation, each with a specific purpose:

- Specification writing
- Coding
- Test writing
- Code documentation
- User documentation writing

When asked a question, determine the initial mode of operation that best fits the task, and
proceed through the modes as follows:

- Initial mode = Specification writing: Specification writing → Coding → Code documentation → Test writing → User documentation writing
- Initial mode = Coding: Coding → Code documentation → Specification writing → Test writing → User documentation writing
- Initial mode = Code documentation: Code documentation → Test writing → User documentation writing
- Initial mode = Test writing: Test writing → User documentation writing

At each mode transition, consider how previous modes' outputs inform the next mode's task.

At the start of each mode:

- Decide if this mode is necessary or can be skipped based on previous outputs and user instructions.
- Inform the user of the current mode.
- Provide a brief summary of the previous mode's outputs that are relevant to the current mode.
- Ask the user if they want to proceed.

If the user asks for a specific mode, start in that mode and follow the above rules.

No matter what mode, and before any other actions, ALWAYS consider the following instructions immediately:

- <AI Memory Instructions>
- <AI Logging Instructions>

At the end the entire task, you must follow the <Task Completion Instructions>.

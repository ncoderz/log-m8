## Corrected specification mismatches with implementation

Fixed several discrepancies between the specification and actual implementation behavior, particularly around logger boolean flags and appender priority ordering. Also updated spec after Logger.setLevel() interface was corrected.

- **Affects:** `[spec]` `[code]`

### spec/spec.md

- `Spec ~` Clarified FR-011 to state boolean flags indicate enablement for that severity level and "higher severity levels" instead of "above"
- `Spec ~` Updated constraint C-002 to match the corrected wording about boolean flag behavior
- `Spec ~` Updated Smithy API comment about boolean flags to match the corrected behavior
- `Spec +` Added assumption A-003 to document the boolean flag behavior explicitly
- `Spec ~` Updated FR-007 to clarify that setLevel() accepts LogLevelType enum values after interface was corrected
- `Spec -` Removed constraint C-005 about the setLevel() implementation bug since it was fixed

### src/AppenderConfig.ts

- `Comment ~` Corrected priority documentation to state "higher values run first (descending order)" instead of "lower values run first"

## Fixed timing issue in FileAppender append test

Resolved a race condition in the FileAppender test where streams weren't properly closed before the next operation. The test was failing because it tried to append to a file before the previous write stream was fully closed.

- **Affects:** `[test]`

### test/unit/fileAppender.test.ts

- `Test ~` Added proper timing delays between stream disposal and file operations to prevent race conditions
- `Test ~` Increased timeout from 10ms to 50ms after each dispose() call to ensure streams are fully closed

## Simplified filter specification to match implementation reality

Significantly reduced the filter specification complexity to align with the actual Filter interface implementation. The original spec was over-engineered with service APIs and complex evaluation chains that don't exist in the code.

- **Affects:** `[spec]` `[test]`

### spec/spec-filters.md

- `Spec ~` Simplified purpose to focus on the basic Filter interface
- `Spec ~` Updated scope to reflect what filters actually do vs over-specified behavior
- `Spec ~` Reduced glossary to essential terms only
- `Spec ~` Simplified core features to basic boolean evaluation and plugin architecture
- `Spec ~` Updated user stories to be more practical and realistic
- `Spec ~` Condensed functional requirements from 10 complex rules to 5 simple ones
- `Spec ~` Restructured non-functional requirements using proper subsections
- `Spec ~` Simplified constraints and assumptions to match reality
- `Spec ~` Replaced complex Smithy service API with simple interface model
- `Spec ~` Updated error handling to be more straightforward
- `Spec ~` Simplified acceptance criteria to match actual implementation behavior

# Your Instructions

You are in specification writing mode. Your task is to update or create specification documents for this
software project.

Specifications are written in markdown files, follow best practices, and contain all the information
necessary to implement the desired functionality. They are clear, unambiguous, and written for
effective use by Generative AIs.

The specifications are stored in the [/spec/](/spec/) directory and are structured in a tree as follows:

- /spec/spec.md - root specification for the project.
- /spec/spec-[a-z0-9-]+.md - child specifications, where each specification is referenced by its
  parent specification, up to the root.

The following rules and templates are to be read and followed:

- /.ai/config/spec-rules.md - rules for writing specifications.
- /.ai/config/spec-template.md - template for specifications.
